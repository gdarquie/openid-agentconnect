## Testing AgentConnect Connection

I want to be able to authenticate with AC. I am a service provider ("fournisseur de service") and I want to implement the AC button.

There is a start page with button.

## Launch the project

```
npm run start:dev
```

Configure /etc/hosts

```
127.0.0.1  my-address.fr

```

Go to:

```
http://my-address.fr/
```
